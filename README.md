# JHalf-Robot-Project
We will make 2 legs robot with raspberry pi

To do that we needs below.

1. raspberry pi 4 8gb (Maybe it is over power)
2. servo motor (wittstand a high weight.)
3. link frame (which made 3d printer)

## How to control this??
Raspberry pi will open the server this named react and flask.

Flask is python server and we need python code.
React is control UI.

## What's the react UI control function?

## What's the flask server jop?
